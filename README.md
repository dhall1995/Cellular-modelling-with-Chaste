# DhallChasteProject

Selection of scripts for a rotation project I spent in Prof. Jennifer Nichol's Lab in the University of Cambridge Stem Cell Institute
attempting to model the early development of the mouse embryo. This project was done under the supervision of Dr. Sarah-Jane
Dunn (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sarajand/), Prof. Jenny Nichols (https://www.stemcells.cam.ac.uk/research/pis/nichols)
and Dr. Alex Fletcher (http://maths.dept.shef.ac.uk/maths/staff_info_715.html).

The project was developed using the CHASTE Software package for C++ (https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/trac) and closely followed a 
general framework laid out in the paper 'Four simple rules that are sufficient to generate the mammalian blastocyst - Nissen et. al
2017' (http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2000737)
